        <p>We are designing a new digital service to replace and improve the actual paper base one for the Criminal Injury Compensation Authority.</p>
        <p>I started as a software developer at the discovery stage, but I mostly worked on <strong>User Research and Design</strong> until late in the private Beta stage (July 2016 - April 2018) in collaboration with the User Researchers and a Content Designer.</p>
        
        
        <p><img class="img-full-width" src="assets/images/user-needs.jpg" alt="GDS phases diagram"/></p>
        
        <h2>The difficulties - pain points</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>recruiting and interviewing victims of crimes is challenging</li>
          <li>most members of the team were new to Agile / Scrum and to User Centered Design when we started in 2016</li>
          <li>the service is complex so the outcome for the applicant is hard to anticipate in some cases</li>
          <li>tight timing</li>
          <li>some users have very low digital skills but we still want them to succeed first time</li>
        </ul>
       
        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>I was in charge of the <strong>high fidelity prototypes</strong>, using <a href="https://govuk-prototype-kit.herokuapp.com/docs" target="_blank" rel="noopener" >the toolkit</a> provided by the Government Digital Service, following closely their guidelines to comply with the Digital by Default policy of the GOV.UK.</p>
        <p class="margin-top-2">I've been heavily involved with the <strong>User Researchers and UX Design work</strong>:</p>
        <uL>
          <li>creating personas based on phone calls recordings from our users, interviews with various stakeholders</li>
          <li>designing low fidelity wireframes of the various themes emerging from the UR discovery</li>
          <li>establishing our user journeys</li>
          <li>creating discussion guides prior to users interview</li>
          <li>taking notes during interviews or usability testing</li>
          <li>gathering insights via various methods (affinity mapping for example)</li>
          <li>creating scenarios for usability testing</li>
          <li>designing remediation and improvements to our design patterns, flows and content afterward</li>
        </uL>
        <p class="margin-top-2">I created <strong>guidance documents</strong> to improve the team understanding of Agile / Scrum ways of working, the different forms of testing involved, the new collaboration tools (Jira, Confluence, Slack), Cucumber and BDD.</p>
        <p class="margin-top-2">I tested the <strong>accessibility</strong> of our website and new functionalities prior to audits.</p>
        <p class="margin-top-2">I <strong>contributed to the coding</strong> of the external users facing part of our service along two senior developers. We are using: JavaScript, EJS, NodeJS, Git, Swagger, Sails and Jenkins.</p>

        <h2>Helping users to upload documents</h2>
        <p>This is one of the functionalities we have to design for our service.</p>
        <p>We researched how other services where doing it (Passport Office / Disclosure Scotland), then created paper wireframes, and tested it. Based on the outcomes, I created wireflow diagrams, coded a high fidelity prototype on which we did iterations of usability testing.</p>
        <p>The flow diagram below was one of the possible solutions I created using Sketch. You can <a href="assets/CICA-flow-upload.pdf" download="Upload_flow_diagram.pdf">download a PDF</a> version.</p>
        <p>

            <img class="img-full-width" src="assets/images/hero-cica-1.png" alt="Flow diagram for uploading a document"/>
          </a>
        </p>
        
        <p>Examples of blue guidance screens created for the prototypes and tested (Mobile views). I created the images which are used live at the moment. A potential new career as a hand model ;-) :</p>

          </a>
          <a href="assets/images/upload2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Opens the guidance screen in a new tab">
            <img class="img-mobile-screen" src="assets/images/upload2.png" alt="Guidance screen to take the photo"/>
          </a>
        </p>
        
        <p>This is an ongoing project (May 2018). The upload functionality has a much better success rate, even with low digital skills users, but we are still working to improve it.</p>
