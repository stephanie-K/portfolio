        <p><strong>What this talk is about:</strong></p>
        <p>In this talk, I start with accessibility, neurodiversity and digital capability, and go beyond by looking at people’s context. 
          I introduce the concept of universal barriers, which shifts the focus from the individual to the barriers anyone can face, using my own personal experience of applying for the EU Settled status to illustrate inclusion issues.</p>
        <p>I give recommendations to deliver inclusive services and to improve ways of working, so inclusion for the end users also start within your own Agile team.</p>
        <p>The session format is 45 mins talk and 15min for questions.</p>

      <h3>Accessibility ...and beyond</h3>
      <p><img  src="assets/images/Accessibility-and-beyond/slide5.svg" 
        alt="3 oval shapes overlapping, 
        a yellow for accessibility to include everyone, 
        an orange one for neurodiversity and 
        a blue one for digital capability for people with no or low access or skills to go online"/></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>When you are delivering services and products, you start with accessibility, to include disabled people, more and more now, people think about neurodiversity as well which is good.</p>
        <p>Some might argue that this is part of accessibility, but many neurodivergent people do not consider themselves disabled, so I chose to represent it as different shape on this slide but still overlapping with accessibility.</p>
        <p>And then, some people go beyond and also think about digital capability.</p>
        <p>This is where we want to include people who might not be able to go online either because they have no access to internet, or people might lack the skills or the confidence to use internet.</p>
        <p>The shapes on the slide overlap because many people in these groups do not fit nicely in just one category.</p>
        <p>I will also go further than this in term of inclusion, but first I want to cover the bases.</p>

      <h2 class="yellow">Accessibility</h2>
      <h3 class="mauve">1 in 4 people are disabled in the UK</h3>
        <p>A disability can affect your vision, your hearing or your speech.</p>
        <p>It can be a physical disability​ or a cognitive disability​, this means it affects your memory, ​or how you process things, communicate and think​.</p>
        <p>It can also be a mix of more than one disability​. </p>
        <p>In fact,it’s quite frequent that people have more than one disability and they are not always visible to others.</p>
        <p>It’s different for everyone.</p>
        <p>Source for 1 in 4: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2022-to-2023/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2022-to-2023#disability-1">disability prevalence by age group - GOV.UK</a></p>
      <h3 class="mauve">Defining accessibility</h3>
      <p>“Accessibility means that people can do what they need to do in a similar amount of time and effort as someone that does not have a disability.	</p>
      <p>It means that people are empowered, can be independent, and will not be frustrated by something that is poorly designed or implemented.”	</p>

      <h3>2 Models to consider disability</h3>
      <table class="no-line-border-right">
        <tr style="font-size:1.2em;">
          <th style="color: #073763;background-color:#cfe2f350;">Medical model</th>
          <th style="color: #741B47;background-color:#ead1dc50;">Social model</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="background-color:#cfe2f350;">A person is disabled by their impairments or differences</td>
          <td style="background-color:#ead1dc50;">A person is disabled by society not accommodating their impairments</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="background-color:#cfe2f350;">→ use: ‘people with disabilities’</td>
          <td style="background-color:#ead1dc50;">→ use: ‘disabled people’</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="background-color:#cfe2f350;">→ look at what is wrong</td>
          <td style="background-color:#ead1dc50;">→ look at what the person needs</td>
        </tr>
      </table> 

      <p>During this session I’ll be using the social model of disability, which is what we should be using in the UK.</p>

      <h2 class="orange">Neurodiversity</h2>
      <p>As mentioned before, it can be considered as a subset of accessibility and when we talk about cognitive disabilities, it’s often related to neurodiversity.</p>
      <h3 class="mauve">An umbrella term</h3>
      <p>Neurodiversity is an umbrella term which cover conditions like:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li> Dyslexia</li>
        <li>Autism</li>
        <li>ADHD (=A ttention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder)</li>
        <li>Dyspraxia</li>
        <li>Dyscalculia</li>
        <li>OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder)</li>
        <li>and more</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is a lot of overlap between these conditions.</p>

      <h3 class="mauve">How it affects people</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>think, process information and language</li>
        <li>interact socially and communicate with others</li>
        <li>perceive space and time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some of the symptoms can be experienced by anyone, but you should avoid saying you are ‘a bit’ ADHD, or ‘a bit’ OCD for example, because neurodivergent people experience this all the time.</p>
      <p>In talk about ADHD, I’ve heard a speaker (Ben Raine) used this comparison: everyone might be out of breath at some point, but you would not say: “Oh I’m a bit asthmatic.”</p>
        </p>
      <h3 class="mauve">1 in 7 people are neurodivergent in the UK</h3>
      <p>This is about 15 to 20% of the general population.</p>
      <p>But it’s often underestimated and under-declared.</p>

      <p>It’s much higher for people working in Tech.</p>
      <p>→ above 20% and <span style="color: #741B47"><strong>probably up to 50% in tech</strong></span> and the creative industry.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>It’s often underestimated and under declared because even though things are improving,  it’s still often perceived negatively, so people are wary of disclosing.</p>
        <p>Many people don’t have a diagnosis, it takes a lot of time to get one, and some people are not even aware that they are neurodivergent, especially women, as the description of these conditions are still full of stereotypes and more representative of young boys than girls and even less of adult women who often have learned to cope and mask.</p>
        <p>It’s very hard to have reliable numbers, I’ve got 3 sources:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://wearetechwomen.com/major-new-report-from-the-tech-talent-charter-reveals-tech-employers-massively-underestimate-neurodivergence-in-their-workforce/">Major new report from the Tech Talent Charter reveals tech employers massively underestimate neurodivergence</a> - We are Tech women (Feb 2024)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.creativereview.co.uk/neurodiversity-creative-industry-experience/"> What it’s like being neurodivergent in the creative industries</a>  - Creative review (Avril 2024)</li>
          <li><a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/6613/pdf/"> Written evidence given to a UK Parliament committee (PDF)</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you consider the people in your Agile team, it’s very likely that quite a few are neurodivergent.</p>
        <p>I’ll come back to this at the end when talking about inclusion within your Agile team.</p>

      <h3 class="blue">Access to internet in the UK in 2024</h3>
      <p style="color: #741B47"><strong>1.6 million people do not have internet</strong></p>
      <p>about 2.3%</p>
      <p style="color: #073763"><strong>16.8 million may struggle to interact with online services</strong></p>
      <p>about 23% - this nearly 1 in 4 people</p>
      <p>(Source: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-inclusion-action-plan-first-steps/digital-inclusion-action-plan-first-steps">Digital Inclusion Action Plan - GOV.UK Feb 2025</a>)</p>
      <h3 class="blue">How people access internet</h3>
      <p>People who do have access could still:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>have slow internet</li>
        <li>be data poor</li>
        <li>only have a mobile</li>
        <li>rely on old devices</li>
        <li>live in area where the network is unreliable</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>So it’s important to keep this in mind, to design services which people can access on an old mobile for example, without too much data
        and to have alternatives to access your service. </p>

        <p>Most of the time, lack of resources is the reason why people don’t have access, but there might be other reasons. </p>
        <p>For example, in case of cyber harassment, stalking or domestic abuse, some people might choose not to use internet anymore for their own safety. So it’s not always a lack of resources.</p>
