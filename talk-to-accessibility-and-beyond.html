        <p><strong>What this talk is about:</strong></p>
        <p>In this talk, I start with accessibility, neurodiversity and digital capability, and go beyond by looking at people’s context. 
          I introduce the concept of universal barriers, which shifts the focus from the individual to the barriers anyone can face, using my own personal experience of applying for the EU Settled status to illustrate inclusion issues.</p>
        <p>I give recommendations to deliver inclusive services and to improve ways of working, so inclusion for the end users also start within your own Agile team.</p>
        <p>The session format is 45 mins talk and 15min for questions.</p>

      <h2 class="blue">Being inclusive</h2>
      <h3>Accessibility ...and beyond</h3>
      <p><img  src="assets/images/Accessibility-and-beyond/slide5.svg" 
        alt="3 oval shapes overlapping, 
        a yellow for accessibility to include everyone, 
        an orange one for neurodiversity and 
        a blue one for digital capability for people with no or low access or skills to go online"/></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>When you are delivering services and products, you start with accessibility, to include disabled people, more and more now, people think about neurodiversity as well which is good.</p>
        <p>Some might argue that this is part of accessibility, but many neurodivergent people do not consider themselves disabled, so I chose to represent it as different shape on this slide but still overlapping with accessibility.</p>
        <p>And then, some people go beyond and also think about digital capability.</p>
        <p>This is where we want to include people who might not be able to go online either because they have no access to internet, or people might lack the skills or the confidence to use internet.</p>
        <p>The shapes on the slide overlap because many people in these groups do not fit nicely in just one category.</p>
        <p>I will also go further than this in term of inclusion, but first I want to cover the bases.</p>
      </blockquote>
      <h2 class="yellow">Accessibility</h2>
      <h3 class="mauve">1 in 4 people are disabled in the UK</h3>
        <p>A disability can affect your vision, your hearing or your speech.</p>
        <p>It can be a physical disability​ or a cognitive disability​, this means it affects your memory, ​or how you process things, communicate and think​.</p>
        <p>It can also be a mix of more than one disability​. </p>
        <p>In fact,it’s quite frequent that people have more than one disability and they are not always visible to others.</p>
        <p>It’s different for everyone.</p>
        <p>Source for 1 in 4: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2022-to-2023/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2022-to-2023#disability-1">disability prevalence by age group - GOV.UK</a></p>
      <h3 class="mauve">Defining accessibility</h3>
      <p>“Accessibility means that people can do what they need to do in a similar amount of time and effort as someone that does not have a disability.	</p>
      <p>It means that people are empowered, can be independent, and will not be frustrated by something that is poorly designed or implemented.”	</p>			
      <p>Source: <a href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/16/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-accessibility-2/">GOV.UK Blog post</a></p>
      <h3>2 Models to consider disability</h3>
      <table class="no-line-border-right">
        <tr style="font-size:1.2em;">
          <th style="color: #073763;background-color:#cfe2f350;">Medical model</th>
          <th style="color: #741B47;background-color:#ead1dc50;">Social model</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="background-color:#cfe2f350;">A person is disabled by their impairments or differences</td>
          <td style="background-color:#ead1dc50;">A person is disabled by society not accommodating their impairments</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="background-color:#cfe2f350;">→ use: ‘people with disabilities’</td>
          <td style="background-color:#ead1dc50;">→ use: ‘disabled people’</td>
        </tr>
        <tr>
          <td style="background-color:#cfe2f350;">→ look at what is wrong</td>
          <td style="background-color:#ead1dc50;">→ look at what the person needs</td>
        </tr>
      </table> 

      <p>During this session I’ll be using the social model of disability, which is what we should be using in the UK.</p>

      <h2 class="orange">Neurodiversity</h2>
      <p>As mentioned before, it can be considered as a subset of accessibility and when we talk about cognitive disabilities, it’s often related to neurodiversity.</p>
      <h3 class="mauve">An umbrella term</h3>
      <p>Neurodiversity is an umbrella term which cover conditions like:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li> Dyslexia</li>
        <li>Autism</li>
        <li>ADHD (=A ttention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder)</li>
        <li>Dyspraxia</li>
        <li>Dyscalculia</li>
        <li>OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder)</li>
        <li>and more</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is a lot of overlap between these conditions.</p>

      <h3 class="mauve">How it affects people</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>think, process information and language</li>
        <li>interact socially and communicate with others</li>
        <li>perceive space and time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some of the symptoms can be experienced by anyone, but you should avoid saying you are ‘a bit’ ADHD, or ‘a bit’ OCD for example, because neurodivergent people experience this all the time.</p>
      <p>In talk about ADHD, I’ve heard a speaker (Ben Raine) used this comparison: everyone might be out of breath at some point, but you would not say: “Oh I’m a bit asthmatic.”</p>
        </p>
      <h3 class="mauve">1 in 7 people are neurodivergent in the UK</h3>
      <p>This is about 15 to 20% of the general population.</p>
      <p>But it’s often underestimated and under-declared.</p>

      <p>It’s much higher for people working in Tech.</p>
      <p>→ above 20% and <span style="color: #741B47"><strong>probably up to 50% in tech</strong></span> and the creative industry.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>It’s often underestimated and under declared because even though things are improving,  it’s still often perceived negatively, so people are wary of disclosing.</p>
        <p>Many people don’t have a diagnosis, it takes a lot of time to get one, and some people are not even aware that they are neurodivergent, especially women, as the description of these conditions are still full of stereotypes and more representative of young boys than girls and even less of adult women who often have learned to cope and mask.</p>
        <p>It’s very hard to have reliable numbers, I’ve got 3 sources:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://wearetechwomen.com/major-new-report-from-the-tech-talent-charter-reveals-tech-employers-massively-underestimate-neurodivergence-in-their-workforce/">Major new report from the Tech Talent Charter reveals tech employers massively underestimate neurodivergence</a> - We are Tech women (Feb 2024)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.creativereview.co.uk/neurodiversity-creative-industry-experience/"> What it’s like being neurodivergent in the creative industries</a>  - Creative review (Avril 2024)</li>
          <li><a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/6613/pdf/"> Written evidence given to a UK Parliament committee (PDF)</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you consider the people in your Agile team, it’s very likely that quite a few are neurodivergent.</p>
        <p>I’ll come back to this at the end when talking about inclusion within your Agile team.</p>

      <h2 class="blue">Digital capability</h2>
      <h3 class="blue">Access to internet in the UK in 2024</h3>
      <p style="color: #741B47"><strong>1.6 million people do not have internet</strong></p>
      <p>about 2.3%</p>
      <p style="color: #073763"><strong>16.8 million may struggle to interact with online services</strong></p>
      <p>about 23% - this nearly 1 in 4 people</p>
      <p>(Source: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/digital-inclusion-action-plan-first-steps/digital-inclusion-action-plan-first-steps">Digital Inclusion Action Plan - GOV.UK Feb 2025</a>)</p>
      <h3 class="blue">How people access internet</h3>
      <p>People who do have access could still:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>have slow internet</li>
        <li>be data poor</li>
        <li>only have a mobile</li>
        <li>rely on old devices</li>
        <li>live in area where the network is unreliable</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>So it’s important to keep this in mind, to design services which people can access on an old mobile for example, without too much data
        and to have alternatives to access your service. </p>

        <p>Most of the time, lack of resources is the reason why people don’t have access, but there might be other reasons. </p>
        <p>For example, in case of cyber harassment, stalking or domestic abuse, some people might choose not to use internet anymore for their own safety. So it’s not always a lack of resources.</p>

      <h2 class="blue">...and Beyond!</h2>
      <h3 class="blue">What makes a person’s identity?</h3>
      <p><img  src="assets/images/Accessibility-and-beyond/slide18.svg" 
        alt="A black circle named 'Identity' with labels for Disability, Neurodiversity, but also Ethnicity, age, gender, body size, medical condition, sexual orientaton, ways to communicate, beliefs, culture and education.
        Next to it, there is a rounded rectangle named 'Circunstances' with a label for Digital capability, but also income and social class, living and working situation, caring responsibilities"/></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>We are going to look at what makes a person’s identity. On screen we have a big black circle to represent a person’s identity.</p>
        <p>We already thought about considering potential disabilities a person might have or neurodivergence, so I’m adding these labels on the identity circle.</p>
        <p>We also considered their digital capability, I’ve put the label for this on the side, because that’s not so much about their identity, but more about their circumstances.</p>
        <p>So I’m making a new space to start thinking about circumstances that might actually impact you at a point in time. </p>
        <p>For digital capability, you might be travelling and your network might not be reliable or you might be using a new device you are not familiar with or simply trying to do something new to you.</p>
        <p>So this is our starting point, but there is a lot more to consider.</p>
        <p>In term of identity, we could add ethnicity, age, or gender, but also things like body size, any medical condition you might have, sexual orientation, and the way you communicate.</p>
        <p>And then there are also things like beliefs, culture or education.</p>
        <p>So now it’s much more busy on this identity circle.</p>
        <p>But just like for digital capability, your circumstances could also affect you a lot.</p>
        <p>So under circumstances, I’m also adding income and social class, living and working situations and caring responsibilities.</p>
        <p><strong>All these things will affect your experience of services and products, but also how others will perceive you.</strong></p>
      </blockquote>
      <h3 class="blue">Inclusive design</h3>
      <p>Depending on what you are designing, if you overlook one aspect of the identity of your user, you might exclude some people without meaning to.</p>
        <p><strong>→ Inclusive design aims to respect the identity of the people using your service or product.</strong></p>
      <h2 class="mauve">Common inclusion issues</h2>
      <h3 class="mauve">Gender and Ethnicity</h3>
      <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Asking in a way that doesn't allow you to identify yourself correctly</p>
      <p><strong>Solution</strong></p>
      <ul>
        <li>do you really need to ask?</li>
        <li>research / test with your users</li>
      </ul>
      <p><img  src="assets/images/Accessibility-and-beyond/gender.png"

        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
          <p>For Black people and afro hair, your photo might be rejected even though you respect the rules because the AI has been trained only or mostly with photos of white people.</p>

          <p>Like for accessibility, testing with a wide range of people should help preventing the exclusion of people using your service in ways you might not have realised.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>Now that we have looked at the various aspects of the identity and some common inclusion issues, I’d like to <strong>shift the focus from the individual, to the barriers anyone can face</strong> instead.
        Because it might be better to look at it this way.</p>
        <p>We tend to focus on set categories of people who are 'the problem', when in fact it's the design that excludes and it can happen to anyone.</p>

        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>Let me clarify what I mean by capacity.</p>
        <p>Ability is what a person can do, in general, they have the skills to do it. So a person might have skill 1,2,3 and 4</p>
        <p>Capability, is what a person can do in a specific context, depending on the time and space. The person might now only have skills 1 and 3</p>
        <p>Capacity, is what a person can do, taking into account what is going on for them. In that case, they might only have skill 3 left.</p>
        <p>So for example: ​I’m able to read something on my phone. I have this ability in general. It might be very sunny  or if my battery is running out, I might be on saving mode and my screen could be less contrasted 
        but even in this context, I might still have the capability to read.</p>
        <p>But now, if I’m tired on top of things, or have a lot on my mind then I might not have the capacity to focus and read.​</p>
        <p>So it’s not just about ability, you need to take the wider context of the person into account as well.</p>

          <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
          <p>I’m going to give you an example, it’s when I applied to the EU settled status.</p>
          <p>When you think of someone experiencing barriers to use a service, you probably don’t think about me, a person who is actually working in digital and creating services as her day job…</p>
          <p>Using the 11 universal barriers and looking at the time I’ve applied for the EU settled  Status, here are some of those I’ve experienced.</p>
          <p><strong>Enthusiasm</strong>: I really didn’t want to apply and in fact when the service was launched, I was still really hoping it would not come to this, so I was in no rush to use this service.</p>
          <p><strong>Access</strong>: initially it was only available on Android, so 2 of my children could not apply from their iPhone and were relying on accessing an android device to apply.</p>
          <p><strong>Evidence</strong>: to justify my eligibility, I had to provide document to evidence this. The documents had to be in my own name, showing my address and the date they were covering.</p>
          <p>5 years were to be covered and we were only allowed to upload 10 documents. For other document, I was unsure is they had to be in English, like for birth certificates?</p>
          <p><strong>Emotional state</strong>: succeeding or not was going to affect my ability to stay in the UK and it was also going to affect my children’s future.</p>
          <p>I probably should also add here that, I’m using my own personal experience, but I realise that I’m still very privileged, because if I had to leave the country, there are other countries I could go to, and my life and my family would not be in danger so other people could be in a much worse emotional stress than this.</p>
          <p><strong>Trust</strong>: I had very little trust in the Home Office, and when asked to mail my passport initially, (which was not normally part of the process)  I withdrew my application as the risk for my passport to be lost in the mail or by the Home Office felt too high for me. I also don’t trust the French authorities either to re-do one easily.</p>
          <p>For others, awareness was going to be an issue if they didn’t watch the news or speak English, or thought that having British kids means they didn’t have to apply for example.</p>
          <p>Not that long ago, in the news, there were a few cases of people who had physical documentation which they thought was still valid and that they didn’t have to apply for the EU settled status. But now they are at risk of deportation, so awareness is a huge issue.</p>
          <p>Comprehension could have been an issue too for people who didn’t speak English well enough, and then the interface and interaction skills could also have been an issue, as well as self confidence.</p>

          <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
          <p>The universal barriers are a work in progress. </p>
          <p>Personally I would make two changes to these barriers.</p>
          <p>The ‘Enthusiasm‘ barrier could be better named, like ‘Motivation’, because when thinking about a service delivered by the public sector, I can’t think of any I would be enthusiastic to use. And it’s probably ok. </p>
          <p>I think ‘Fear‘ should be a barrier in itself, it could be covered by the ’emotional state’ and ‘trust’ barriers, but when you work with refugees or victims of domestic abuse for example, there is a real fear that using some services might put you at risk. </p>
          <p>Poverty can also make you really stressed when applying for services as some people fear that if they don’t do it right , they might lose benefits for example.</p>
          <p>You could probably think of other things that are relevant to your own service or product.</p> 
          <p>You can use the barriers for inspiration and make it work for you, this is not set in stone.</p>
