      <h2 class="alt-h2">Summary</h2>
      <br>
        <p><strong>My experience is mainly in the public sector</strong>: a local authority, the Scottish Government and the Central Government (Ministry of Justice and the Department for Education).</p>
        <p><strong>My projects covered all stages (Discovery, Alpha, Beta and live)</strong>. I worked in various roles: from frontend developer to interaction design and now service design. On some projects, I worked on the content or user research too.</p>
        <p><strong>I have experience of the service standards assessments at every stage</strong>, some on the GOV.UK one and others on the Scottish version of it: the Digital Scotland Service Standard (DSSS).</p>
        <p><strong>I've used the GOV.UK Design system and its prototype kit</strong> which I customised while working in a local authority.</p>
        <p><strong>For all projects, I try to be as inclusive as possible and design with accessibility in mind</strong> right from the start. </p>
