        <h3>Advocating for an Agile and User Centred approach for the Digital Transformation of the CICA Online Service </h3>
        <p class="date">June 16 - August 18    |  Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority - Glasgow</p>
        <p>On board since the <strong>Discovery phase</strong> in July 2016, in a team where most members were new to Agile and User Centred Design. I took part in creating the <span class="cv-highlight">service blueprints, persona, journey maps, User Research activities</span> during the Discovery phase. All along, I provided <span class="cv-highlight">guidance, documents and presentations</span> to understand the various artefacts for the design, <span class="cv-highlight">the Scrum framework</span>, how to use new <span class="cv-highlight">collaboration tools</span> (JIRA, Confluence, Slack) and some technical aspects of our work.<br></p>
        <p>During the <strong>Alpha phase</strong>, I was more focussed on working on the <span class="cv-highlight">prototypes</span>, designing <span class="cv-highlight">usability testing sessions</span> with our User Researcher, <span class="cv-highlight">analysing and improving our design based on users' feedback</span>. The prototypes were also used as a <span class="cv-highlight">communication and presentation tool of our design solutions to various stakeholders</span> (Management, internal users, Victims Supports groups). This contributed to the promotion of our new ways of working when building a service with the users.<br></p>
        <p>During the <strong>Private Beta phase</strong>, working very closely with our Content Manager, Service Designer, and User Researcher, I went on prototyping but also did more in terms of Inclusive Design, working to find solutions for <span class="cv-highlight">assisted digital users,</span> writing guidance for the Customer Support Staff, organising their training and up skilling. I also tested our system with <span class="cv-highlight">assistive devices</span>.</p>
