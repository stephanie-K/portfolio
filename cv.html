        <h3>Advocating for an Agile and User Centred approach for the Digital Transformation of the CICA Online Service </h3>
        <p class="date">June 16 - August 18    |  Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority - Glasgow</p><br>
        <p>On board since the <strong>Discovery phase</strong> in July 2016, in a team where most members were new to Agile and User Centred Design. I took part in creating the service blueprints, persona, journey maps, User Research activities during the Discovery phase. All along, I provided guidance, documents and presentations to understand the various artefacts for the design, the Scrum framework, how to use new collaboration tools (JIRA, Confluence, Slack) and some technical aspects of our work.<br></p><br>
        <p>During the <strong>Alpha phase</strong>, I was more focussed on working on the prototypes, designing usability testing sessions with our User Researcher, analysing and improving our design based on users' feedback. The prototypes were also used as a communication and presentation tool of our design solutions to various stakeholders (Management, internal users, Victims Supports groups). This contributed to the promotion of our new ways of working when building a service with the users.<br></p><br>
        <p>During the <strong>Private Beta phase</strong>, working very closely with our Content Manager, Service Designer, and User Researcher, I went on prototyping but also did more in terms of Inclusive Design, working to find solutions for assisted digital users, writing guidance for the Customer Support Staff, organising their training and up skilling. I also tested our system with assistive devices.</p>
