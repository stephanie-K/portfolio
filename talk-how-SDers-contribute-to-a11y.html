      <h2 class="purple">About me</h2>
      <h3 class="purple">Learning about accessibility</h3>
      <p><img  src="assets/images/how-a-service-designer-contribute-to-a11y/learning-accessibility.svg" 
        alt="timeline with logos of place of work and what I've done in 3 roles described in the speaker notes"/></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>To tell you the story about how we came up with a new guidance for the service designer role in the accessibility manual, I need to tell you a bit more about me.</p>
        <p>In 2016, I was a graduate developer for MoJ - I was learning about accessibility from the GOV.UK service manual, from senior colleagues, and it was about how to code so that the interface would be accessible for people using it. I learned to test my code and to use screen readers and screen magnifiers to check the result.</p>
        <p>In 2018, I  switched to UX design - so being accessible was more about the design, using the right components, colours, using the design system correctly, but I also did some research, for this,  it was about recruiting people who were disabled, planning more time for them and ensuring that my consent form enabled them to really understand what they were consenting to. I was lucky at the time as it was easy to recruit because I had access to a person who could help me and very well connected in the community.</p>
        <p>In 2019, I finally became a Service designer! I was still often the one person going on and on about accessibility, and I started public speaking about accessibility.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3 class="purple">Each role in a multi-disciplinary team has a part to play to avoid making a service inaccessible</h3>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>Because of my experience going from one role to another, I was very aware that each role in a multi-disciplinary team has a different part to play to avoid making a service inaccessible.</p> 
        <p>It works better if everyone knows their part, so that the accessibility of a service do not rely on one single very keen individual reminding everyone what they should be doing.</p>
        <p>This is why guidance per role feels really important to me.</p>

      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
                <p>When the manual was first created in 2021, it was unique. Nothing like that existed in government even though it was badly needed.</p>
        <p>Now there is also the <a href="https://accessibility.education.gov.uk/">DfE accessibility and inclusion manual</a> but in terms of guidance per role, they do not have much yet.</p>
        <p>The manual was very useful and very well received at the time. My favourite part was the guidance per role, so I started pointing people to it during my presentations, at work, or outside work.</p>
        <p>You could find the guidance for the roles on the slide but there was no guidance for the service designer role.</p>
        <p>There was also nothing for the Accessibility specialist role but it’s been added since.</p>
        <p>You can <a href="https://web.archive.org/web/20210731122848/https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/guidance-for-your-job-role">access the manual in the state it was at the time via this link</a>, using the wayback machine.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3 class="purple">Joining DWP in 2023</h3>
      <p>When I joined DWP in 2023 as a contractor, I talked to Tom Napier, he is a senior accessibility specialist.</p>
      <p>I contacted him about the project I was on, but in the conversation, I mentioned the manual and it turned out he was the one in charge of maintaining it.</p>
      <p>I told him how I kept directing people to it even before I joined DWP, but then the service designer role was missing from the list.</p>
      <p>There were 2 reasons, not enough time just now, but also he was unsure about what a service designer does and how this contributes to accessibility.</p>
      <p>So I don’t know about the other service designers in the room, but every time I join a project team, no one seems to be too sure about what a service designer do …. apart from creating maps maybe?</p>
      <p>I keep having to explain what I do. </p>
      <p>Tom was happy to work on a guidance with me.</p>

      <h3 class="purple">The service designer role</h3>
      <p>I started looking at: </p>
      <ul>
        <li><a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/service-standard/point-5-make-sure-everyone-can-use-the-service">point 5 of the service standard</a> which describes what is needed to make sure everyone can use the service, which includes disabled people</li>
        <li><a href="https://apply-the-service-standard.education.gov.uk/service-standard/5-make-sure-everyone-can-use-the-service">the guidance of the Department for Education’s guidance on how to apply the service standard for point 5</a> as they go in a bit more details</li>
        <li> I’ve checked the description of the service designer within the <a href="https://ddat-capability-framework.service.gov.uk/role/service-designer">Government Digital and Data Profession Capability Framework</a></li>
        <li>finally I’ve added elements from my own practice as a service designer </li>
      </ul>
      <p>So that’s all the material I had to start working on a guidance.</p>

      <h3 class="purple">Involving the Service Design Community</h3>
      <p><img  src="assets/images/how-a-service-designer-contribute-to-a11y/timeline-guidance-creation.svg" 
        alt="timeline with 3 dates explained in the speaker notes"/></p>
      <p><img  src="assets/images/how-a-service-designer-contribute-to-a11y/Service Design Community day.jpeg" 
        alt="9 members of the service design community standing, working at whiteboards in an office room, with colourful sofa and cushions on the forefront"/></p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>So that was my initial plan, but I wanted to involve the wider service design community in DWP too, because I’m just one service designer, and there are different ways to practice service design.</p>
        <p>We worked on this with the DWP Service design community September 2024.</p>
        <p>So enters Lindsay Stephens, who organises the Service Design community events in DWP along with Shalom. There was nothing planned for the next one, so I suggested presenting what I had done to give some context, and then we could work on this as a community. We had invited Tom to the session so he could hear first hand what we felt our role was regarding accessibility. </p>
        <p>Plot twist 1 - contractor’s life, my contract was terminated earlier than planned in December.</p>
        <p>Plot twist 2 - I got a new contract in DWP in February 2025.</p>
        <p>I contacted Tom again, asking if he add worked on the guidance, and he had a really good draft already - I gave him feedback, but again I felt I needed to involve the Service Design community again, and we had a Community day coming up in March.</p>
        <p>So again we worked on this in groups to refine the guidance and it got much better as a result.</p>
        <p>We had a few questions as well, for example, we needed resources for physical accessibility, because as service designer we look at all the channels, not just the digital ones and wanted to make sure we had pointers in the guidance to help with making physical events accessible.</p>
        <p>Tom added some good sources on this and shortly after the guidance was published.</p>
      </blockquote>

      <h3 class="purple">Takeaways from that story</h3>
      <ul>
          <li>never too old to change career</li>
          <li>you can contribute to the community of practice as a contractor</li>
          <li>involve contractors in your community of practice</li>
          <li>keep pushing</li>
          <li>involve other practitioners</li>
      </ul>
      <p>By myself I can do a lot, and can control the timeline better, but by involving the service design community, it took this guidance much further, and made it better in the end.</p>

      <h3 class="purple">April 2025</h3>
      <p>Since April 2025, the service designer role has its guidance page. Which makes me really happy.
          I’m going to tell you a bit more about the guidance itself now that you now how it came to be created.
          It covers:</p>
      <ul>
          <li>WCAG Conformance</li>
          <li>Non-digital accessibility</li>
          <li>Design communication</li>
          <li>Design together</li>
          <li>When you can’t make a part of your service accessible</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I’m going to go in a bit more details about each of them during the rest of the talk.</p>
      <p><img class="img-half-width"  src="assets/images/how-a-service-designer-contribute-to-a11y/SD-guidance.png" 
        alt="page of the DWP Accessibility manual showing the guidance for the service designer job role"/></p>
      <p><a href="https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/guidance-for-your-job-role/service-designer">Guidance for the Service Designer role</a>.</p>

      <h3 class="purple">What’s different in this role?</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>“Your overview of the end-to-end service may give you an insight into inclusivity for both external and internal users”</li>
        <li>“You’ll design journeys across both digital and offline channels”</li>
        <li>Non digital accessibility: <a href="https://business.scope.org.uk/toolkit/accessible-event-planning-toolkit/">Accessible events toolkit</a> from <a href="https://www.scope.org.uk/">Scope</a></li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>Others on your team might not have this insight, so you should be an advocate in your team for all your user, both internal and external.</p>
        <p>Parts of your service, as well as some of your design activities, might occur offline, or non-digitally. You must consider non digital accessibility too.</p>
        <p>Disability charity Scope has lots of guidance around accessibility in the built environment. Scope provides guidance for users on <a href="https://www.scope.org.uk/advice-and-support/checking-event-venue-accessibility">how to check the accessibility of an event or venue</a>. </p>
        <p>This can be useful to understand what things you should consider when parts of your service require people to attend a place in person.</p>

      </blockquote>

      <h3 class="purple">When you can’t make part of your service accessible</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>a service, technically accessible online might not be the best solution</li>
        <li>you can and should ask for help from accessibility specialists</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>There are 2 meanings to this: you are in a situation where an alternative option is a better than spending a lot of time on making a digital solution more accessible.</p>
        <p>For example, consider the digital self-check-in at Jobcentres. It might be difficult to change accessibility settings if you need to use a screen reader and cannot hear in the busy environment. Speaking to a person could provide a better experience. </p>
        <p>Bringing the community along with me to improve the guidance highlights that some service designer might not know how to make things accessible by themselves. We are not trained to do this, so if no one in your team can help, you need to work with accessibility specialists (in your department, cross government, but you could also bring in associations).</p>

      <h2 class="yellow">Accessibility</h2>
      <h3 class="purple">1 in 4 people are disabled in the UK</h3>
        <p>A disability can affect your vision, your hearing or your speech.</p>
        <p>It can be a physical disability​ or a cognitive disability​, this means it affects your memory, ​or how you process things, communicate and think​.</p>
        <p>It can also be a mix of more than one disability​. </p>
        <p>In fact,it’s quite frequent that people have more than one disability and they are not always visible to others.</p>
        <p>It’s different for everyone.</p>
        <p>Source for 1 in 4: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2022-to-2023/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2022-to-2023#disability-1">disability prevalence by age group - GOV.UK</a></p>
      <h3 class="purple">Defining accessibility</h3>
      <p>“Accessibility means that people can do what they need to do in a similar amount of time and effort as someone that does not have a disability.	</p>
      <p>It means that people are empowered, can be independent, and will not be frustrated by something that is poorly designed or implemented.”	</p>			
      <p>Source: <a href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/16/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-accessibility-2/">GOV.UK Blog post</a></p>
     
      <h3 class="purple">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG)</h3>
        <p>This is the standard you need to comply with for digital accessibility.</p>
        <p>Currently, version 2.2</p>
        <p><a href="https://accessibility-manual.dwp.gov.uk/accessibility-law/web-content-accessibility-guidelines">Web Content Accessibility Guidelines</a> (WCAG)</p>	
        <p>Published by the <a href="https://www.w3.org/">World Wide Web Consortium</a> (W3C)</p>
        <p>We have a link to this in the guidance, but it’s not always easy to engage with - DWP accessibility manual have some more engaging guidance around this.</p>

      <h2 class="orange">Neurodiversity</h2>
      <p>I’m going to tell you a bit more about neurodiversity as well. It can be considered as a subset of accessibility. When we talk about cognitive disabilities, it’s often related to neurodiversity.</p>
      <h3 class="purple">An umbrella term</h3>
      <p>Neurodiversity is an umbrella term which cover conditions like:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li> Dyslexia</li>
        <li>Autism</li>
        <li>ADHD (=A ttention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder)</li>
        <li>Dyspraxia</li>
        <li>Dyscalculia</li>
        <li>OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder)</li>
        <li>and more</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is a lot of overlap between these conditions.</p>

      <h3 class="purple">How it affects people</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>think, process information and language</li>
        <li>interact socially and communicate with others</li>
        <li>perceive space and time</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="purple">1 in 7 people are neurodivergent in the UK</h3>
      <p>This is about 15 to 20% of the general population.</p>
      <p>But it’s often underestimated and under-declared.</p>
      <p>It’s much higher for people working in Tech.</p>
      <p>→ above 20% and <span style="color: #513184 ; background-color: #fff2cc;"><strong>probably up to 50% in tech</strong></span> and the creative industry.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>It’s often underestimated and under declared because even though things are improving,  it’s still often perceived negatively, so people are wary of disclosing.</p>
        <p>Many people don’t have a diagnosis, it takes a lot of time to get one, and some people are not even aware that they are neurodivergent, especially women, as the description of these conditions are still full of stereotypes and more representative of young boys than girls and even less of adult women who often have learned to cope and mask.</p>
        <p>It looks like these numbers are much higher for people working in tech.</p>
        <p>It’s very hard to have reliable numbers, I’ve got 3 sources:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://wearetechwomen.com/major-new-report-from-the-tech-talent-charter-reveals-tech-employers-massively-underestimate-neurodivergence-in-their-workforce/">Major new report from the Tech Talent Charter reveals tech employers massively underestimate neurodivergence</a> - We are Tech women (Feb 2024)</li>

          <li><a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/6613/pdf/"> Written evidence given to a UK Parliament committee (PDF)</a></li>
        </ul>
        <p>If you consider the people in your team, it’s very likely that quite a few are neurodivergent.</p>
        <p>I’ll come back to this at the end when talking about designing with your team and communicating your design.</p>
      </blockquote>
 
      <h3 class="purple">Cognitive Accessibility Guidelines (COGA)</h3>
      <p>This is a set of guidelines for inclusive design, also published by the W3C. It covers a lot of issues around neurodiversity and was included in the guidance for our role as it’s very useful</p>
      <p>The Department for Education has a really engaging version of COGA</p>

          <li>Use clear and understandable content</li>
          <li>Help users avoid mistakes and know how to correct them</li>
          <li>Help users focus</li>
          <li>Ensure processes do not rely on memory</li>
          <li>Provide help and support</li>

      <h3 class="purple">Accessibility vs Inclusion</h3>
      <p><img  src="assets/images/how-a-service-designer-contribute-to-a11y/a11y-inclusion.svg" 
        alt="a big purple oval shape for inclusion. Within it, there is a yellow oval shape for accessibility and another orange oval shape for neurodiversity which mostly overlap the yellow one."/></p>
      <p>To finish covering the bases, I want to talk about the scope of the guidance. It is for accessibility, which includes neurodiversity.</p>
      <p>But many neurodivergent people do not consider themselves disabled, so I chose to represent it as different shape on this slide but still overlapping with accessibility.</p>
      <p>As a service designer, we should be aiming for inclusion which is wider than just accessibility.</p>
      <p>Point 5 of the service standard mentions disabled people but also digital capability, as we need to include people who do not have access to internet or who might lack the skills or the confidence to use online services.</p>
      <p>For me, inclusion is even wider than accessibility and digital inclusion: it’s about respecting the identity and circumstances of each person using your service.</p>
      <p>The guidance for the service designer role is mentioning inclusion a few times, but its focus is mostly on Accessibility.</p>



      <h2 class="purple">Designing for everyone</h2>

      <h3 class="purple">General recommendations</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>think of accessibility right from the start</li>
        <li>involve disabled people at every stage of your research <br>
          remember:  <span style="color: #513184 ; background-color: #fff2cc;">1 in 4 people is disabled</span></li>
        <li>don’t forget internal users</li>
        <li>everyone in your team needs needs to be involved</li>
        <li>ask for feedback (accessible and not only online)</li>
      </ul>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>You need to think about accessibility right from the start, not at the very end as it will influence your decisions all along.</p>
        <p>Don’t forget internal users, they could also have accessibility issues while delivering the service, so do think about them too.</p>
        <p>Make sure everyone in your team understand how to avoid making things inaccessible without meaning to.</p>
        <p>Make it easy for people to tell you when something is not right. </p>
        <p>Even if you have done a really good work, you are likely to overlook some issues, so this feedback is crucial to keep improving your service.</p>
        <p>If your feedback mechanism is only online and not accessible, you are going to miss out on a lot of inclusion issues… </p>
        <p>So make sure the way you request feedback is accessible and not only online.</p>

      <h3 class="purple">Numbers</h3>
      <p><span style="font-weight: 600; color: #513184 ; background-color: #fff2cc; ">Low numeracy affects half the working-age adults in the UK</span></p>

      <p><img class="talk-big" src="assets/images/Accessibility-and-beyond/do-dont-low-numeracy.png" 
        alt="Do…
        round numbers up to the nearest whole number.
        Do leave space around numbers.
        Do fill in the information you already have.
        Do use sentences to add context about numbers.
        Do let people include spaces when entering numbers.
        Do user research with people who struggle with numbers.
        Do not…
         use decimals unless it's money.
        Do not overwhelm people with too much content.
        Do not expect users to repeat or remember numbers.
        Do not use tables or grids without explaining what the numbers mean.
        Do not rush users to enter numbers accurately.
        Do not force people to enter a number or do a sum to verify themselves."/></p>
        <blockquote>
          <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
          <p>Don’t forget about users with dyscalculia and low numeracy.</p>
          <p>Low numeracy affects half the working-age adults in the UK - this is a lot of people among your users but it could also be your colleagues, in your team or among people delivering the service.</p>
          <p>To learn more about this, you can check the <a href="https://accessiblenumbers.com/">Accessible numbers project</a> by Laura Parker,there is advice and podcast episodes to understand how to do better. I really recommend it.</p> 
          <p>A while ago now, Laura worked with Rachel Malic and Jane McFadyen to create a new do and don’t poster for designing for people with dyscalculia or low numeracy:  <a href="https://designnotes.blog.gov.uk/2022/11/28/designing-for-people-with-dyscalculia-and-low-numeracy/">link to a blogpost explaining how they made this poster</a>.</p>
          <p>The Accessible numbers project has advice and podcast episodes for you to learn more about the problems and how to do better.</p>

            <h3 class="purple">Organising - hosting a meeting</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>before the meeting: set expectations, provide an agenda, do it again at the start of the actual meeting</li>
        <li>invite people to tell you if this might not work for them</li>
        <li>if using online tools like Mural or Miro, plan for an alternative</li>
        <li>if over an hour → plan for a break and stick to it</li>
        <li>repeat the question someone asked before answering unless you’re sure everyone has heard/seen it</li>
      </ul>
      <h3 class="purple">Presenting during a meeting</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>share your slides at the start of a presentation or in your invite</li>
        <li>keep content short and simple</li>
        <li>use plain English, explain jargon and acronyms</li>
        <li>use a mic, speak facing your audience, camera on if online</li>
        <li>leave some space at the bottom of your slides </li>
        <li>describe any image/ diagram, assume at least one person cannot see</li>
        <li>don’t assume people can read the text on slides</li>
      </ul>
