      <h2 class="yellow">Accessibility</h2>
      <h3 class="purple">1 in 4 people are disabled in the UK</h3>
        <p>A disability can affect your vision, your hearing or your speech.</p>
        <p>It can be a physical disability​ or a cognitive disability​, this means it affects your memory, ​or how you process things, communicate and think​.</p>
        <p>It can also be a mix of more than one disability​. </p>
        <p>In fact,it’s quite frequent that people have more than one disability and they are not always visible to others.</p>
        <p>It’s different for everyone.</p>
        <p>Source for 1 in 4: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/statistics/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2022-to-2023/family-resources-survey-financial-year-2022-to-2023#disability-1">disability prevalence by age group - GOV.UK</a></p>
      <h3 class="purple">Defining accessibility</h3>
      <p>“Accessibility means that people can do what they need to do in a similar amount of time and effort as someone that does not have a disability.	</p>
      <p>It means that people are empowered, can be independent, and will not be frustrated by something that is poorly designed or implemented.”	</p>			
      <p>Source: <a href="https://accessibility.blog.gov.uk/2016/05/16/what-we-mean-when-we-talk-about-accessibility-2/">GOV.UK Blog post</a></p>
     
      <h2 class="orange">Neurodiversity</h2>
      <p>As mentioned before, it can be considered as a subset of accessibility and when we talk about cognitive disabilities, it’s often related to neurodiversity.</p>
      <h3 class="purple">An umbrella term</h3>
      <p>Neurodiversity is an umbrella term which cover conditions like:</p> 
      <ul>
        <li> Dyslexia</li>
        <li>Autism</li>
        <li>ADHD (=A ttention Deficit and Hyperactivity Disorder)</li>
        <li>Dyspraxia</li>
        <li>Dyscalculia</li>
        <li>OCD (Obsessive Compulsive Disorder)</li>
        <li>and more</li>
      </ul>
      <p>There is a lot of overlap between these conditions.</p>

      <h3 class="purple">How it affects people</h3>
      <ul>
        <li>think, process information and language</li>
        <li>interact socially and communicate with others</li>
        <li>perceive space and time</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Some of the symptoms can be experienced by anyone, but you should avoid saying you are ‘a bit’ ADHD, or ‘a bit’ OCD for example, because neurodivergent people experience this all the time.</p>
      <p>In talk about ADHD, I’ve heard a speaker (Ben Raine) used this comparison: everyone might be out of breath at some point, but you would not say: “Oh I’m a bit asthmatic.”</p>
        </p>
      <h3 class="purple">1 in 7 people are neurodivergent in the UK</h3>
      <p>This is about 15 to 20% of the general population.</p>
      <p>But it’s often underestimated and under-declared.</p>

      <p>It’s much higher for people working in Tech.</p>
      <p>→ above 20% and <span style="color: #741B47"><strong>probably up to 50% in tech</strong></span> and the creative industry.</p>
      <blockquote>
        <p><strong>Speaker notes:</strong></p>
        <p>It’s often underestimated and under declared because even though things are improving,  it’s still often perceived negatively, so people are wary of disclosing.</p>
        <p>Many people don’t have a diagnosis, it takes a lot of time to get one, and some people are not even aware that they are neurodivergent, especially women, as the description of these conditions are still full of stereotypes and more representative of young boys than girls and even less of adult women who often have learned to cope and mask.</p>
        <p>It’s very hard to have reliable numbers, I’ve got 3 sources:</p> 
        <ul>
          <li><a href="https://wearetechwomen.com/major-new-report-from-the-tech-talent-charter-reveals-tech-employers-massively-underestimate-neurodivergence-in-their-workforce/">Major new report from the Tech Talent Charter reveals tech employers massively underestimate neurodivergence</a> - We are Tech women (Feb 2024)</li>
          <li><a href="https://www.creativereview.co.uk/neurodiversity-creative-industry-experience/"> What it’s like being neurodivergent in the creative industries</a>  - Creative review (Avril 2024)</li>
          <li><a href="https://committees.parliament.uk/writtenevidence/6613/pdf/"> Written evidence given to a UK Parliament committee (PDF)</a></li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you consider the people in your Agile team, it’s very likely that quite a few are neurodivergent.</p>
        <p>I’ll come back to this at the end when talking about inclusion within your Agile team.</p>

      <h3 class="purple">1. Start with accessibility</h3>
      <p>Only one part of inclusive design but well documented.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>think of it from the start</li>
        <li>involve disabled people at every stage of your research <br>
          remember:  <span style="font-weight: 600; color: #073763; background-color:#cfe2f350; ">1 in 4 people is disabled</span></li>
        <li>don’t forget internal users</li>
        <li>everyone in your team needs is involved</li>

         use decimals unless it's money.
        Do not overwhelm people with too much content.
        Do not expect users to repeat or remember numbers.
        Do not use tables or grids without explaining what the numbers mean.
        Do not rush users to enter numbers accurately.
        Do not force people to enter a number or do a sum to verify themselves."/></p>
