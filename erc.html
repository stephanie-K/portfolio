        <h1 class="work">East Renfrewshire Council - Applying for Council housing</h1>
        
        <p class="margin-top-2">Using my GDS experience I have introduced the GDS prototype kit and coded high fidelity prototypes of forms for user testing. This was a completely new way of working for all.</p>

        <h2>My Role</h2>
        <p>Working with the content designer, a digital customer officer, the Housing department, a developer, support workers and interpreters.</p>
          <ul>
            <li>introduce good practices, GDS ways of working, and the prototype kit</li>
            <li>raise awareness of accessibility issues, differences between browsers, the need for progressive enhancement</li>
            <li>advocate for looking at the whole service, not just the frontend side, and avoiding looking at different forms in isolation</li>
            <li>facilitate and organise User Research sessions and user testing with various users, including refugees who were non native English speakers, and homeless participants</li>
          </ul>.
  
          <h2>Challenges</h2>
          <ul>
            <li>our Content Management System (CMS) generates technological constrains which makes recreating some design patterns difficult (progressive disclosure, editable summary for example)</li>
            <li>the service had 4 paper forms: applying, medical priority, bidding for a property and amending your details, but we needed to see the service as a whole, not in 4 distinct parts</li>
            <li>we didn't have an authentication method yet so without login we couldn't save and return to the form safely</li>
            <li>the backend systems are minimal, so the design can't be as simple and efficient without the possibility to retrieve data previously entered</li>
            <li>tight timing and work already quite advanced when I started but some requirements and business needs were still unclear or missing</li>
            <li>prototyping, user testing and User Centred Design was new to most in the team</li>
            <li>some legal points like GDPR or the possibility to use the National Insurance number as a way to identify the user were still under discussion</li>
          </ul>

          <h2>Design</h2>
        <p><strong>I've adapted the prototype kit to reflect the Council brand and own style.</strong></p>
        <p>Adapting the colours for the links:</p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/erc-colours-image.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Opens the colour code page in a new tab">
          <img class="img-three-quarters-width with-border" src="assets/images/erc-colours-image.png" alt="colours codes and preview of various link status"/>
        </a></p>
        <p class="margin-top-2">The prototype uses the <strong>same components and most patterns</strong> of the <a href="https://design-system.service.gov.uk/" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="open thr GDS Design system homepage in annew tab">GDS Design system</a></p>
        <p>But I took into account some IT constrains to avoid prototyping patterns our CMS could not reproduce.</p>
        <p>Examples of GDS conditional radio buttons with input fields reveal, and GDS error messages:</p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/erc-medicalPriority2.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Opens the radio button example in a new tab">
          <img class="img-half-width with-border" src="assets/images/erc-medicalPriority2.png" alt="an example of radio buttons with conditional nested input field for a form "/></a>
          <a href="assets/images/erc-medcialPriority-error.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Opens the GDS error message example in a new tab">
          <img class="img-half-width with-border" src="assets/images/erc-medcialPriority-error.png" alt="an example of error message for a checkbox"/></a>
        </p>
        <p class="margin-top-2"><strong>This is responsive.</strong></p>
        <p>Amending your details - on desktop/mobile view:</p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/erc-amend-desktop.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Opens the amendment page of the form as desktop view in a new tab">
          <img class="img-three-quarters-width with-border" src="assets/images/erc-amend-desktop.png" alt="one page of the amendment form - desktop view"/></a>
          <a href="assets/images/erc-amend-mobile.png" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Opens the amendment page of the form as mobile view  page in a new tab">
          <img class="img-one-quarter-width with-border" src="assets/images/erc-amend-mobile.png" alt="one page of the amendment form- mobile view"/></a>
        </p>

        <p class="margin-top-2"><strong>I created flow diagrams to highlight the logic rules in the journey</strong> as the form had over 50 potential different screens.</p>
        <p><a href="assets/images/CBL-flow3-logic.pdf" target="_blank" rel="noopener" title="Opens a logic flow diagram in a new tab">
          <img class="img-half-width with-border" src="assets/images/CBL-flow3-logic.png" alt="a logic flow diagram"/></a>

        </p>

        <h2>Outcome</h2>
       <ul>
         <li>this is a particularly complex service but the new approach was well received by the IT and Housing departments who felt more involved in the design</li>
         <li>the prototype was a new visual and concrete way to collaborate between the teams</li>
         <li>testing with a very diverse audience helped gather good insights including some edge cases (non English speakers, homeless teens)</li>
         <li>during testing most users were succeeding to complete the form first time, but there was room for improvement</li>
         <li>explaining the design rationale of the GDS patterns and potential accessibility issues allowed a better understanding from the Housing team and improved the collaboration dynamic</li>
       </ul>
      <p class="margin-top-2"><strong>This was ongoing and not live yet when I left in February 2019.</strong></p>
